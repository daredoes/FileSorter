# FileSorter

A rumps tool to keep folders and files organized.

**CURRENTLY REQUIRES UNAVAILABLE RUMPS CODE - WILL BE MERGED SOON**

---


Comes with default folders and extension groups!

## How It Works

Folders are established by providing the human-readable name of the folder, for the menu bar, and the path to the folder, including support for `~`

Files are found in these folders when being sorted by their extension.

Extensions go into a category with a human-readable name, this will become the folder name the extensions are sorted into.

Extensions should **not** start with a `.`, and will be forced into lowercase for storage and comparison, but not during movement.
